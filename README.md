Project Introduction:
Central to the mission of a decentralized news web application powered by blockchain is an unwavering commitment to transparency, authentication, and data integrity. By harnessing the immutable nature of blockchain technology, the platform ensures that every piece of news content is rigorously verified, maintaining its integrity from source to reader. The editorial and verification processes are conducted openly, allowing 
users to trace the origin and credibility of news articles without revealing sensitive information. This emphasis on transparency and authentication not only promotes trust but also safeguards user privacy, fostering an ecosystem where the authenticity of news prevails, unmarred by censorship or manipulation.
